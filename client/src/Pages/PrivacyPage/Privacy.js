            <p>
              The information collected from you is used in different ways. We
              use the information to process your registration, attend to your

              other request you have made, conduct research and generally
              improve our service delivery to you. The information collected is
              also used to prepare reports for our internal use and for our
              current or potential partners e.g. investors, sponsors,
              advertisers, and other potential agents. 3. We may from time to
              time wish to provide you with information on new and exciting
              features of the APP or any other service we believe may be of
              interest to you. Sometimes, we might want to provide you with
              related information from third parties we think may be of interest
              to you. Your information could also be provided to selected third
              parties, our partners, or affiliates whose services we believe may
              be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive these kinds
              of communications, you can opt-out by unchecking the appropriate
              announcement boxes during registration or on the user profile page
              on the APP. Alternatively, you can send an email to
              support@vigho.co We occasionally engage other companies to provide

              parties except in the manner described in this policy. We
